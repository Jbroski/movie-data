Information about US movie box office 2011-2016

## Background
My office is doing a pool to predict the best performing summer blockbuster movies. I want to see if it's possible to gain an advantage using the power of data! This repository contains my attempts to predict movie performance using publicly available data.

Hopefully, this can also be used as an introductory tutorial for basic data science techniques.
